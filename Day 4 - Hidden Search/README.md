# Hidden Search

This is a mini web development project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases a hidden search bar that expands when clicked. This project is part of the "50 Days, 50 Projects" challenge.

Check out the live demo of this project [here](https://tushar1441.github.io/50-Days-50-Projects/Day%204%20-%20Hidden%20Search/index.html).

## Concepts Used

The HTML file contains a search bar represented using the "form" and "input" elements. The search bar is initially hidden from view.

The search button is positioned absolutely above the hidden search box using the "position" property, and the "transition" property is used to create a smooth animation when the search bar is expanded.

The JavaScript file contains functions for toggling the visibility of the search bar and updating its size and position when it is expanded. The "addEventListener" method is used to detect when the search icon is clicked, and the "classList" property is used to add and remove CSS classes to toggle the visibility and size of the search bar.


## Additional Notes

This project demonstrates the use of basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts to create an engaging user interface. The hidden search bar is a common feature in many modern websites, and by understanding how it is built, you can begin to create your own custom designs.
